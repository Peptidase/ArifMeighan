## Data Science Portfolio - Arif Meighan

This portfolio is a compilation of different Data Science and Data Analysis projects I have contributed to. It includes several academic, hobby, and passion projects from which I have learned to expand my understanding of my quantitative studies further.

## Projects

Utilized alternating least squares algorithm to model the relationship between users and products. The algorithm is capable of providing novel and intuitive game recommendations based on a user's preference for genre, publisher, and developer. It is capable of cold start recommendation where a user has no background of activity to recommend from. Groups of users with similar preferences are recommended games within their group that align with their user-product interaction tuple.

A project based on measuring the performance of graph neural networks on the coras citation dataset. Utilizing a dataset with sparse and densely connected nodes allows for an extensive testing environment to observe how the hyperparameters, aggregation methods, and architecture of graph neural networks affect the performance of a model.

I was interested in analyzing the possible correlation between housing prices and the level of crimes. I observed that ASB (Anti-Social Behaviour) was a good indicator of housing prices but not rental prices. Utilized geospatial vector and raster structures to create chloropleth visualizations of the districts with their respective crime statistics. For a clearer copy of the code please do not hesitate to directly contact me.
