Utilized alternating least squares algorithm to model relationship between users and products. Algorithm is capable of providing novel and intuitive game recommendations based on a users preference to genre, publisher and developer. Is capable of cold start recommendation where a user has no background of activity to recommend from. Groups of users with similar preferences to are recommended games within their group that align with their user-product interaction tuple.

A project based on measuring the performance of graph neural network on the coras citation dataset. Utilizing a dataset with sparse and densely connected nodes allows for an extensive testing enviroment to observe how the hyperparameters, aggregation methods and architecture of graph neural networks affects the performance of a model.
